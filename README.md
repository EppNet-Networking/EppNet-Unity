# High-Performance Efficient Networking for Unity
**E++Net** (*pronounced eip net*) **for Unity** is the Unity integration [E++Net](https://github.com/EppNet-Networking/EppNet), a **blazing-fast UDP-based
networking library powered by ENet**. Designed for **performance, scalability, and ease of use**, it takes the pain out of networking
so you can **focus on building your game -not fighting your network code**.


🚀 **FAST, REALLY FAST**: Minimal allocations and built for high throughput  
🎯 **Easy to Use**: Inherit from `INetworkObject` and place attributes **over methods or properties** you would like to delegate to E++Net  
🛡️ **Secure**: Server authoritative and ensures clients are on the right build of your app  
📉 **Low Bandwidth**: Sends only what's necessary and uses bitpacking and algorithms to limit datagram sizes  
🕹️ **Full Unity Support**: Buttery smooth physics, snapshotting, interpolation and extrapolation, lag compensation, and prediction included.
